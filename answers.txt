Q1: Why might be consider using git?

Answer: Git help manages code and data changes when working with a team! It's a good way to manage changes to source code over time by tracking modifications and allowing multiple developers to collaborate on the project.

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give and Example and how it might help

Answer: Data science is an interdisciplinary field, combining computational and statistical techniquesto gain insight in a given field. One field that data science is commonly used in is medicine. For example, you can use data science to analyze a patient's medical record and predict a disease outbreak. In other words, by looking at raw data like medical records, patient demographics, and lab results, you can later discover insights and predictions that assists in identifying patterns in patient data. These patterns can help predict diseaes outbreaks, optimize treatment plans, and provide insights for medical research.


Q3: What is the difference between merging and rebasing?

Answer: Git rebase reapply commits ontop of another base tip. On the other hand, git merge simply merges two developmental histories together. In other words, git merge combines changes from one branch into a different branch, while rebase moves changes from one branch to a different branch, but it does NOT combine changes. A nice difference I like to think too is that git merge helps maintain developmental history while git rebase can change that history.

Q3: What skills do you hope to improve during this course?

Answer: I want to improve my data collecting skills, such as web scraping. I have always wondered how web scraping works and how people can just collect endless amount of information. I also want to improve my skills in SQL and pandas, as I used a bit of it during my internship, but I could not maxmimize my efforts due to my lack of knowledge in those areas.
